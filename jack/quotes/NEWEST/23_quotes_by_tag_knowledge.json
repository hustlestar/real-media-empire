People with performance goals, in contrast, tend to like to do easy jobs that make them look good. They want to be judged positively. Although these two different orientations appear to characterize two different people, the same person can adopt different orientations under different environmental conditions. And it ends up that the particular conditions under which people are more apt to adopt mastery goals bear striking similarities to Montessori environments (Ames, 1992, see chapter 5)."

It is clear, from the archaeological evidence, that the grand villa on the slopes of the Acropolis was confiscated not long after the philosophers left. It is also clear that it was given to a new Christian owner. Whoever this Christian was, they had little time for the ancient art that filled the house. The beautiful pool was turned into a baptistery. The statues above it were evidently considered intolerable: the finely wrought images of Zeus, Apollo and Pan were hacked away. Mutilated stumps are now all that remain of the faces of the gods; ugly and incongruous above the still-delicate bodies. The statues were tossed into the well. The mosaic on the floor of the dining room fared little better. Its great central panel, which had contained another pagan scene, was roughly removed. A crude cross pattern, of vastly inferior workmanship, was laid in its place. The lovely statue of Athena, the goddess of wisdom, suffered as badly as the statue of Athena in Palmyra had. Not only was she beheaded she was then, a final humiliation, placed face down in the corner of a courtyard to be used as a step.",
        "While it might take months of effort, years of training and centuries of accumulated knowledge to build a Greek temple, it took little more than zeal and patience to destroy one. At the end of the fourth century, as the laws against pagans were reaching an aggressive crescendo, the bishop Marcellus was said to have destroyed the vast and still hugely popular temple of Zeus at Apamea with prayers and the help of a man who was \u2018no builder, or mason, or artificer of any kind\u2019. Today, Marcellus is worshipped as a saint in the Orthodox Church.",

Works that have to agree with the pre-ordained doctrines of a church are theology, not philosophy. Free philosophy has gone. The great destruction of classical texts gathers pace. The writings of the Greeks \u2018have all perished and are obliterated\u2019: that was what John Chrysostom had said. He hadn\u2019t been quite right, then: but time would bring greater truth to his boast. Undefended by pagan philosophers or institutions, and disliked by many of the monks who were copying them out, these texts start to disappear. Monasteries start to erase the works of Aristotle, Cicero, Seneca and Archimedes. \u2018Heretical\u2019 \u2013 and brilliant \u2013 ideas crumble into dust. Pliny is scraped from the page. Cicero and Seneca are overwritten. Archimedes is covered over. Every single work of Democritus and his heretical \u2018atomism\u2019 vanishes.

Heretics were intellectual therefore intellectuals were, if not heretical, then certainly suspect. So ran the syllogism. Intellectual simplicity or, to put a less flattering name on it, ignorance was widely celebrated. The biography of St Antony records with approval that he \u2018refused to learn to read and write or to join in the silly games of the other little children\u2019. Education and silly games are here bracketed together, and both are put in opposition to holiness. Instead of this, we learn, Antony \u2018burned with the desire for God\u2019. That this wasn\u2019t quite true \u2013 Antony\u2019s letters reveal a much more careful thinker than this implies \u2013 didn\u2019t much matter: it appealed to a powerful ideal. No need to read: give up both books and bread and you will win God\u2019s favour. Even intellectuals were susceptible to this pretty picture: it was hearing about how the simple, unlettered Antony had inspired so many to turn to Christ that led Augustine to start striking himself on the head, tearing his hair and asking, \u2018What is wrong with us?\u2019 Ignorance was power.",
        "The tens of thousands of books, the remnants of the greatest library in the world, were all lost, never to reappear. Perhaps they were burned. As the modern scholar, Luciano Canfora, observed: \u2018the burning of books was part of the advent and imposition of Christianity\u2019. A war against pagan temples was also a war against the books that had all too often been stored inside them for safekeeping \u2013 a concept that from now on could only be recalled with irony. If they were burned then this was a significant moment in what Canfora has called \u2018the melancholy experiences of the war waged by Christianity against the old culture and its sanctuaries: which meant, against the libraries\u2019. Over a thousand years later, Edward Gibbon raged at the waste: \u2018The appearance of the empty shelves excited the regret and indignation of every spectator, whose mind was not wholly darkened with religious prejudice.",
        "Sex then ought to be contained \u2013 but it was not denied. In the writings of the Roman elite, like any other appetite it was, as Peter Brown has observed, something to be admitted and managed rather than something to be ashamed of. The feast of the Liberalia was on 17 March; a now sadly forgotten festival at which Roman citizens celebrated a boy\u2019s first ejaculation. In Roman medical manuals, ejaculation had been readily and openly discussed by classical doctors who advised it for health and getting rid of the seed that might otherwise cause headaches. It was thought that if athletes could abstain from sex they would be stronger. Orgasms and sex were even recommended for women\u2019s health."

We simply take the long string of digits and put a decimal point in front of it so that it becomes a fraction between 0 and 1, a mere point on a line. Then we choose a smooth stick and declare one end 0 and the other end 1. Measuring carefully, we make a notch in the stick -- a point on the continuum representing the number. All of our history, our philosophy, our music, our art, our science -- everything we know would be implicit in that single mark.

If you are acquainted with all other things any yet remain in a state of ignorance with regard to him alone, you are always wandering beyond the proper point, and your restless love of knowledge increases in the proportion in which knowledge itself is increased.

When we walk into a bookstore, it is easy to feel oppressed by the amount of knowledge on tap. Why don\u2019t we have the same feeling in a forest, at the beach, in a big city, or simply in breathing? There is more going on in our body every second than we will ever understand, and yet we rarely feel bothered by our inability to know it all. Books, however, are designed to make demands on our attention and time: they hail us in ways that nature rarely does. A thing is what Heidegger calls zunichtsgedr\u00e4ngt, relaxed and bothered about nothing. A plant or stone is as self-sufficient as the Aristotelian god or Heidegger\u2019s slacker things, but books are needy. They cry out for readers as devils hunger for souls."

        "Looking back at the knowledge economies discussed earlier, we can recognize that the dynamic coupling of human societies and the Earth system not only depended on the generation of knowledge, but enhanced, in turn, the significance of that generation. In a process extending over millennia, scientific knowledge eventually became a crucial component of economic growth; it is now becoming no less important in coping with its consequences. Substantial anthropogenic change on a global scale was evidently already characteristic of the Holocene and the late Pleistocene, from the human-induced extinction of great mammals via Neolithization and urbanization to the Scientific and Industrial Revolutions. What characterizes the Anthropocene is the need to actively prevent the Earth system from transgressing planetary boundaries. The emergence of this need is closely related to the cascade of evolutionary processes described above. Just as cultural evolution started as a side-show of biological evolution before it became the conditio humana (the essential condition of human life), epistemic evolution, that is, the growing dependence of human societies on knowledge economies producing scientific knowledge, was, for a long time, no more than a tangential aspect of cultural evolution. But with the onset of the Anthropocene, the survival of human culture as we know it hinges on this.",
        "The essential point is that systems of knowledge are never given in their entirety at the outset of an investigation. Their meaning unfolds only gradually, through the exploration of their implications with the help of external representations - for example, by doing calculations, applying a conceptual framework to new circumstances, exposing systems to debate within an epistemic community, and so forth. We therefore speak of the 'generative ambiguity' of external representations, which leads to their seemingly paradoxical function in knowledge transmission: on the one hand, they secure and stabilize the transmission of knowledge over generations, thus ensuring its longevity, while they serve, on the other hand, as tools for thinking and thus agents of change and innovation in the transmission of knowledge.",
        "While the technosphere concept stresses that most humans lack the potential to influence the behavior of large technological systems, the ergosphere concept makes this possibility dependent on the existence of appropriate social and political structures and knowledge systems, and also on the individual perspectives of human actors. One cause for hope is that a knowledge economy produces and distributes not only the knowledge needs for its functioning (and often less) but, to varying degrees, an excess of knowledge (an 'epistemic spillover') that may trigger unexpected developments.",
        "System knowledge alone tends to favor technocratic visions; transformation knowledge by itself may encourage blind activism; orientation knowledge without system and transformation knowledge is idle. But even the combination of these types of knowledge will be useless as long as they are not implemented within a suitable knowledge economy, comprising research, education, public discourse, and political action.",
        "The problem is also not, as suggested by the technosphere concept, that human beings are incapable of controlling systems that have a larger range of behaviors than they do themselves. The problem rather lies in the question of what 'control' means in the first place. The stewardship of technological systems and infrastructures always depends on their specific nature (in particular, the way they are embedded in natural and cultural environment) as well as on their representation in knowledge and belief systems. Human cognition is always embodied cognition. There are historical examples showing that humans have been able to manage and sustain extremely complex ecologies and infrastructures of their own making over the long term. The systems' potential behaviors always far exceeded those of their human components, but these were typically ecologies and infrastructures in which the relevant regulative structures of human behavior had themselves been coevolving over long periods, including in their representation by knowledge and belief systems.",
        "But however desirable an evolutionary framework for a history of knowledge may be, the important questions is whether it is actually possible to recognize an evolutionary logic in the historical records - without imposing it by an exaggerated analogy with biology and without ascending to a level of abstraction where all cats become gray. I believe that the historical findings examined in the preceding chapters point in such a direction, in particular the long-term, cumulative aspects of knowledge development, its dependence on contingent societal contexts, and the profound transformations of the architecture of knowledge."

If you observevery closely, whichever stage we are in, when we ask for love we are actually asking only for the other person\u2019s attention. When we say a person doesn\u2019t love us, we actually mean that the other person doesn\u2019t give us enough attention. The basic need for any human being is attention from others. The attention-need, along with our dependency on others for survival, is what we experience as love.",

Sometimes you allow frustration to get fermented. Sometimes you allow fear to get fermented. But continuously, something or other is getting fermented in you. That is the truth. There is no time when some emotion is not getting fermented in you.",
        "You feeling life is not letting what you want to happen in your life.... For example: You always wanted health, but life is never letting that happen to you. You always wanted wealth, and just one day before you achieve it, everything collapses. Please listen, the very information being given to you, the hope being generated in you that health is possible, wealth is possible, is a solid proof life is supporting you. Otherwise, even that possibility will not be informed to you! You will not be informed even about that possibility! The moment the possibility is informed, life is supporting you; be informed, be very clear!",

Then you will treat the last patient and then it will be time to leave for kailasa and you will take a deep breath and chant \u2018paramashivoham\u2019 and reach kailasa - that\u2019s it.

Hearing his mother\u2019s words, Dhruva just five years old but highly sensitive and self-respecting, very faithful and devotion left the city, determined to devote himself to Vishnu Shreeom worship. He had an opportune meeting with Sage Narada and being instructed in Shreeom sacred name, then Dhurba entered the forest of Madhu, where he engaged himself in severe austerities in adoration and devotion of Shreeom. Finally because of such great devotion Shreeom appeared as a Vishnu and blessed Dhurba. Knowing this, Shreeom affectionately touched his cheek and his body with hand, was the seed of all sound and solving of all the problems of Dhruba. Shreeom had been provided all the necessary knowledge of the world to Dhurba . He then sang Shreeom Vishnu praise, having been purified and enlightened by Shreeom's touch. After many years Dhurba and his mother and father entered the region called Dhruva-loka and lived there joyfully even now as the Pole Star, the Dhruva Tara. That story is about thousands of years ago. Now again in this time Shreeom Vishnu is on earth as a human form with Sankha and Chakra and many Gods and Goddess, Brahmas, Devis, father's and mother's soul all the time, fortunate male and female divinity and Sadhus, Santas, Pandits, scientists and presidents and prime ministers of every nations, kings and queens, pure and Knowledgeable existence are with Shreeom.",

        "Enlightenment is the state of achieved supreme unborn and immortal soul. Human condition in a straightforward way based on spirituality, faith, enthusiasm and wisdom. Most of life is defined by contentment and knowledge. Those, very fortunately, are the leading forces behind much of what we do. Everything is transitory but without kindness and enthusiasm or devotion of being and separate from bad companies we cling desperately to what we know, to what is familiar, even as we intuitively understand it is immortal all the time. Always the enlightened one, trying to express his reality in words or trying to translate non-duality into a dual systems. Breathing exercise is the fundamental level of key to enlightenment. Laghu Rudri, Devi Bhagbatam, Matri Shakti Pooja, Devi Devtas Pooja is the main key to enlightenment and asking with enlighten Gurus, and with your self is the another key to enlightenment. Enlightenment irrevocably reveals the true Self, kind Self, light Self, love Self which has always been there already. This True Self is not something one does not know and which one suddenly discovers for the first time: after all it is one\u2019s own self. It is rather something one knows very well, but its immense meaning has not yet been revealed so far. Enlightenment means that this immense meaning has become clear and remains clear, it is the absolutely fortunate.",

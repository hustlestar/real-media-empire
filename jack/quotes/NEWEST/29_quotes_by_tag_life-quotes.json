Whereas, sadness, anger, enthusiasm, anxiety, fear, confidence, or the state of being disconnected are all different forms of emotions and are equally important for our existence as human beings. Would you call a person who laughs the whole day and is happy about everything hundred percent sane? Rather than spending each moment of our lives until death to just 'live happily ever after', it would be much easier to just learn to accept our emotions and cherish them.

        "There will be times in Life when you will not be understood. When no one will believe in you. People, circumstances and events will all appear to be going against you. That\u2019s when you must soldier on, with faith . When there is no hope, when there is no light, when there appears to be no way forward, that\u2019s when faith comes into play. Anchor in faith. Not through religion or ritual. But have faith in yourself, in a higher energy, and trust the process of Life. Your faith will never lead you astray. It will not show you the way either. Having faith is the way to live intelligently, happily.",
        "What do you do when you don\u2019t know what to do? Well, you can try fighting Life: You can kick around, scream, wallow in self-pity, anger, grief and guilt or you can hide in a metaphorical cave, choosing to live in denial and darkness. But none of those choices will help you. Over time, you will hate your Life even more than you ever did. That\u2019s when you will realize the power of letting go, of going with the flow. When you don\u2019t know what to do, simply trust the process of Life. That trusting, in the present continuous tense, is faith. The willingness to go where you have never been before, the humility to let go and allowing yourself to be led by the unknown, is faith. Now, your problems don\u2019t necessarily disappear when you have faith. Your ability to deal with them improves magically, miraculously, though.

Just because you are educated and have access to money you have always believed that you are in control of Life. But every once in a while, Life will throw a problem at you that you cannot solve. And that\u2019s when you will realize that you are not in control of your Life. You will then understand that, all along, Life was \u2013 and is \u2013 in control. So, letting go and going with the flow of Life is not one of many options you have to live intelligently. It is the only way!",

Let the sadness hold you in its grip. Experience your sadness wholesomely. Cry, if you feel like crying. Over time, you will realize that your sadness is not helping you. That\u2019s when you must let it go. And open yourself up to newer experiences and emotions. Only when you understand the futility of being sad for long spells of time, will you let your sadness go. And only when you let it go, only when you uncling from your sadness, will you be truly happy!",

Material things, rewards, fame, recognition, money and having a circle of \u2018yes\u2019 folks (those who are hanging around you only because they believe they can benefit from you)\u2026these can all make you happy, but only momentarily. They only give you fleeting moments of Happiness. Too much of these, in fact, can leave you feeling drained or suffocated or incomplete. That\u2019s when you start searching for true Happiness. And true Happiness lies only in celebrating what is, in the now. You find it by dropping all your craving, the wants, the desires. It lies in living each moment fully, in gratitude for what you have, with people who complete you, who make you come alive!",
        "When going through an enduring and painful situation, stop wishing that it did not exist. It is this wanting, this desire, that causes your suffering. Instead, deal with each day, doing whatever you can do in the given circumstances. Do your best. And leave the rest, the outcomes, to Life. This is how you flow with Life, at its pace, peacefully, calmly.",
        "Grief has a lasting, and often transformational, impact. It pervades every pore in your body and settles in your soul. You may surely find Happiness over time. But it will be a very different experience being happy again after you have experienced what grief is. What grief does is that it makes you understand contentment as the truest form of Happiness. And that\u2019s what Happiness really is \u2013 it lies in living each moment fully, gratefully, with what you have, with what is.",
        "Life\u2019s pretty simple. If doing something makes you unhappy, and you can avoid it, don\u2019t do it.

This is where you can \u2013 and must \u2013 gain complete control of your daily Life; no matter what your circumstances are. And taming the mind, and training it, requires that you practice daily silence periods, doing only what you love doing. This a daily process. And there\u2019s no one-time achievement of mastery over your mind that you can claim. It is not like a course that you complete and receive a certification upon completion. You must actively engage in this practice \u2013 daily, every single day. Each day you must train your mind. You must train it again, and again, and again. Only this non-negotiable process holds the key to your inner peace and Happiness.",

Yet people often postpone living their lives well waiting for all three factors to fall in place. It makes better sense to go live your Life when you have two out of the three factors within your reach! Particularly, when you have time and health, and perhaps some money. Because when you don't have health/age on your side, you can't do anything even if you have a lot of time and money!",

When going through painful situations, as long as you are complaining about your circumstances, you will find each day long, dreary and miserable to endure. But when you immerse yourself in what you love doing, you will find that each moment is a celebration. You will then be able to flow with Life, joyously, enthusiastically.",
        "No matter what you are going through, no matter what you think is going to happen, stay anchored and engaged with the process of Life.

And as long as you are in the game, well, anything is possible!",
        "When you are a witness to a moment in nature you are celebrating. For instance, when you are watching a sunrise or sunset, you are not processing. You simply are. You are captivated by the spectacle. You are not passing any judgment. You just are. Similarly, occasionally, you must rise to be a witness to your own Life. Not to observe, engage, judge or review. But to just be like a fly on your Life's wall. Be a witness. When you are a witness, you learn more about yourself. And when you employ that learning you transform.",
        "Equanimity is the state when you are unmoved. When all states seem the same: Joy and sorrow, victory and defeat, success and failure, gain and loss; neither a high, nor a low \u2013 none of these states can then affect your equilibrium. There will surely be a momentary blip when any event occurs that causes an emotional response. Metaphorically, it is like what happens when you throw a stone into a placid lake. There will be ripples, a few waves may be generated, but the lake\u2019s water will soon go back to being calm and peaceful. This unmoved state, equanimity, can be attained only through training your mind. You can and must train your mind, just as you train your body. When your mind is in your control, you are unmoved. Only when you are unmoved do you really experience true Happiness.",
        "2 + 2 doesn\u2019t always add up to 4 in Life. Integrity and hard work, for instance, don\u2019t always deliver (worldly) success no matter how talented you are.

And, eventually, what you want will flow to you, on its own.",

For instance, besides being careful with so many other things, you still have to tie your camel, lock your car and, of course, watch over your mobile phone. But faith, in a higher energy, in the process of Life, is an amazing tool. It helps you cope better with complex situations. It may not help you solve your problems immediately. But it can surely help you last longer, so that you can work harder at finding solutions to your problems. Faith also helps immensely in dealing with imponderable, inscrutable, Life situations when no human logic really works. Let\u2019s say you have locked your car and stepped on to the road; and just then an earthquake strikes. Don\u2019t you think it is still possible that you may want to look up at the sky: And pray that you are not swallowed by the earth!? Or, simply, surrender to the process of Life!?",
        "No matter how much you believe you can or want to help someone, you cannot live their Life for them. Everyone\u2019s journey, their design, is unique. They have to go through what they have to go through. If you cannot add value in a specific context, step out of it gracefully. That way you are giving the other person space and protecting your inner peace.",
        "Often times in Life, your efforts may not bring you the results that you want. That\u2019s when you feel frustrated and defeated. But think about it deeply: Life never gave you any guarantees. It never promised you that your efforts will be rewarded instantaneously. So, in reality, it is not Life that is frustrating you. It is your expectation that your effort must immediately yield you a certain result that is frustrating you. Drop that expectation and learn to be non-frustrated. Only then will you be happy. Now, employ your Happiness in working harder. Work smarter. Make your effort unputdownable. And leave the outcome to Life. Enjoy the process of making the effort meaningful instead of craving for the reward that you believe you deserve.",
        "Trust the process of Life. There is a lot of action when you are trusting the process. It is a present continuous state of non-resistance. It involves doing whatever you can do in a given context and allowing yourself to be led by Life. You will then witness the magic and beauty of Life leading you to where you must arrive.",
        "Life is a constant tightrope walk. And every experience that you go through teaches you how walk this tightrope, how to live \u2013 and lead \u2013 in a let go. Leadership is essentially the ability to face any situation in Life and do what needs to be done, efficiently and effectively. And living in a let go means to trust the process of Life. So, leading in a let go is what Life is all about. Master this art and you will learn to live your Life better \u2013 meaningfully, calmly, happily!",

Soon, work on overcoming the shock of the setback, turn around and keep walking. The essence of intelligent living lies in continuing to walk. No matter what happens, don\u2019t allow yourself to be pinned down for too long. Just keep walking. When you keep flowing with Life, the path always unfolds. And Life takes you to where you belong, where you must eventually arrive.",

Both are complementary aha-inducing ways of bringing meaning to an otherwise, apparently, meaningless Life \u2013 because you came with nothing and you will go away with nothing!",

        "Courage is certainly not the absence of fear. The ability to look fear in the eye, to stand up to what scares you, is courage. So, being able to face Life\u2019s upheavals, without giving up, without becoming bitter, is courage. Being able to withstand pain, while choosing to not suffer from it, is courage. Choosing to immerse yourself in what you love doing, when darkness engulfs you, is courage. To let go, and to flow with Life, is courage. Being useful, even when you can\u2019t be successful in a worldly sense, is courage. To live a Life of love, compassion, dignity and cheer, despite constant pain, despite enduring constraints, is courage. To laugh at yourself, at your situation, and at Life, is courage!

But Life\u2019s taken care of your every need. It is in wanting what you don\u2019t have that you grieve. It is in wanting your Life to be different from what it is now that you suffer.

But you will not suffer. You cannot avoid pain, but you can choose not to suffer. Suffering comes from asking 'why\u2019, \u2018why me'. Suffering always magnifies the pain.

There are times we forget our value as a person because we are so blinded with these thoughts of loneliness, emptiness and ego. Somewhere along the road we become numbed with all the frustrations and dissatisfaction. But life itself isn't always about darkness and sadness, Life is also filled with colors and that makes it beautiful. Along this path of darkness there's always light waiting to be seen by our daunted hearts. Our heart is gifted to see this light. It may be hiding behind those circumstances that we encounter; in a stranger we just met at an unexpected place; a family who has been always there but you just ignored because of your imperfect relationship with them; it might be a long time friend you have or a friend you just met. Open your heart and you will see how blessed you are to have them all in your life. Sometimes they are the light that shines your path in some dark phases of life. Don't lose hope"

A few steps through the produce, or preferably circumventing all of it by taking a few extra steps around the perimeter, leads to the sky-blue painted home. Twisting left, hundreds of miles of rolling hills and the occasional home peeps out, bound below by demarcated farming steppes.

But when she says, \"I am moving out and will be open to getting back together when you are getting treatment for your addiction,\" then all of a sudden the addict feels \"I need to get some help or I am going to lose my marriage.\" The need has been transferred. It is the same with any kind of problematic behavior of a person who is not taking feedback and ownership. The need and drive to do something about it must be transferred to that person, and that is done through having consequences that finally make him feel the pain instead of others. When he feels the pain, he will feel the need to change...A plan that has hope is one that limits your exposure to the foolish person's issues and forces him to feel the consequences of his performance so that he might have hope of waking up and changing."

        "My dearest friend Abigail, These probably could be the last words I write to you and I may not live long enough to see your response but I truly have lived long enough to live forever in the hearts of my friends. I thought a lot about what I should write to you. I thought of giving you blessings and wishes for things of great value to happen to you in future; I thought of appreciating you for being the way you are; I thought to give sweet and lovely compliments for everything about you; I thought to write something in praise of your poems and prose; and I thought of extending my gratitude for being one of the very few sincerest friends I have ever had. But that is what all friends do and they only qualify to remain as a part of the bunch of our loosely connected memories and that's not what I can choose to be, I cannot choose to be lost somewhere in your memories. So I thought of something through which I hope you will remember me for a very long time. I decided to share some part of my story, of what led me here, the part we both have had in common. A past, which changed us and our perception of the world. A past, which shaped our future into an unknown yet exciting opportunity to revisit the lost thoughts and to break free from the libido of our lost dreams. A past, which questioned our whole past. My dear, when the moment of my past struck me, in its highest demonised form, I felt dead, like a dead-man walking in flesh without a soul, who had no reason to live any more. I no longer saw any meaning of life but then I saw no reason to die as well. I travelled to far away lands, running away from friends, family and everyone else and I confined myself to my thoughts, to my feelings and to myself. Hours, days, weeks and months passed and I waited for a moment of magic to happen, a turn of destiny, but nothing happened, nothing ever happens. I waited and I counted each moment of it, thinking about every moment of my life, the good and the bad ones. I then saw how powerful yet weak, bright yet dark, beautiful yet ugly, joyous yet grievous; is a one single moment. One moment makes the difference. Just a one moment. Such appears to be the extreme and undisputed power of a single moment. We live in a world of appearance, Abigail, where the reality lies beyond the appearances, and this is also only what appears to be such powerful when in actuality it is not. I realised that the power of the moment is not in the moment itself. The power, actually, is in us. Every single one of us has the power to make and shape our own moments. It is us who by feeling joyful, celebrate for a moment of success; and it is also us who by feeling saddened, cry and mourn over our losses. I, with all my heart and mind, now embrace this power which lies within us. I wish life offers you more time to make use of this power. Remember, we are our own griefs, my dear, we are our own happinesses and we are our own remedies.",

Don't be afraid to go out on a limb. That's where the fruit is. Don't burn bridges. You'll be surprised how many times you have to cross the same river. Don't forget, a person's greatest emotional need is to feel appreciated. Don't major in minor things. Don't say you don't have enough time. You have exactly the same number of hours per day that were given to Pasteur, Michaelangelo, Mother Teresa, Helen Keller, Leonardo Da Vinci, Thomas Jefferson, and Albert Einstein. Don't spread yourself too thin. Learn to say no politely and quickly. Don't use time or words carelessly. Neither can be retrieved. Don't waste time grieving over past mistakes Learn from them and move on. Every person needs to have their moment in the sun, when they raise their arms in victory, knowing that on this day, at his hour, they were at their very best. Get your priorities straight. No one ever said on his death bed, 'Gee, if I'd only spent more time at the office'. Give people a second chance, but not a third. Judge your success by the degree that you're enjoying peace, health and love. Learn to listen. Opportunity sometimes knocks very softly. Leave everything a little better than you found it. Live your life as an exclamation, not an explanation. Loosen up. Relax. Except for rare life and death matters, nothing is as important as it first seems. Never cut what can be untied. Never overestimate your power to change others. Never underestimate your power to change yourself. Remember that overnight success usually takes about fifteen years. Remember that winners do what losers don't want to do. Seek opportunity, not security. A boat in harbor is safe, but in time its bottom will rot out. Spend less time worrying who's right, more time deciding what's right. Stop blaming others. Take responsibility for every area of your life. Success is getting what you want. Happiness is liking what you get. The importance of winning is not what we get from it, but what we become because of it. When facing a difficult task, act as though it's impossible to fail."
